<h2>NAME</h2>
ksdssp - generate <b>HELIX</b> and <b>SHEET</b> records from protein coordinates
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<b>ksdssp</b>
[ <b>-c</b> <i>cutoff</i> ]
[ <b>-h</b> <i>length</i> ]
[ <b>-s</b> <i>length</i> ]
[ <b>-S</b> <i>file</i> ]
[ <i>PDB_file</i> [ <i>output_file</i> ] ]
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<i>Ksdssp</i>
is an implementation of the Kabsch and Sander algorithm for defining
secondary structure of proteins.
<i>Ksdssp</i>
reads a Protein Data Bank format file containing coordinates of
the backbone atoms (N, CA, C, O, and optionally H) of a protein
and generates <b>HELIX</b> and <b>SHEET</b> records.
If an amide hydrogen is missing, it is placed 1.01 angstroms 
from N along the bisector of
<ol>
<li>the vector opposite the bisector of C-N-CA, and
<li>the vector opposite the C-O vector from the previous amino acid.
</ol>
<h2>COMMAND ARGUMENTS</h2>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>-c</b> <i>energy_cutoff</i>
<dd>
The default energy cutoff for defining hydrogen bonds as recommended by
Kabsch and Sander is -0.5 kcal/mol ("A good H-bond has about -3 kcal/mol
binding energy").  This option allows the user to change the cutoff.
<dt>
<b>-h</b> <i>minimum_helix_length</i>
<dd>
Normally, <b>HELIX</b> records for helices of length
three residues or greater are generated.
This option allows the user to change the minimum helix length.
<dt>
<b>-s</b> <i>minimum_strand_length</i>
<dd>
Normally, <b>SHEET</b> records for strands of length
three residues or greater are generated.
This option allows the user to change the minimum strand length.
Reducing the minimum strand length to 1 is not recommended, as there
are bridges in many structures that confuse the
algorithm for defining sheets.
<dt>
<b>-S</b> <i>summary_file</i>
<dd>
Normally, <i>ksdssp</i> silently discards all
the hydrogen-bonding information
after generating the <b>HELIX</b> and <b>SHEET</b> records.
This option makes <i>ksdssp</i>
print the information to a file.  The notation is similar to that used
by Kabsch and Sander, but is in a vertical instead of horizontal format.
<dt>
<i>PDB_file</i>
<dd>
The input Protein Data Bank (PDB) file may contain any legal
PDB records.
Only <b>ATOM</b> records will be used.  All others are silently discarded.
If no
<i>PDB_file</i>
argument is given, the data is read from standard input.
<dt>
<i>output_file</i>
<dd>
The output of <i>ksdssp</i> is a set of PDB
<b>HELIX</b> and <b>SHEET</b> records.
If no
<i>output_file</i>
argument is given, the records are written to standard output.
