To compile this program, you will also need the Protein Data Bank
record I/O library, available via the UCSF Computer Graphics Laboratory
software web page (http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Overview/software.html).
BE SURE TO GET THE C++ VERSION OF THE LIBRARY.

Once you have the pdb++ library compiled, you can compile ksdssp by
editing the Makefile in this directory and fixing the definitions for
the following:

	CXX		C++ compiler
	LINKER		Linker that works with C++ code
	OPT		Options to pass to the compiler
	PDBINCDIR	Name of directory containing the pdb++ header file
	LFLAGS		Options to pass to the linker
	PDBLIBDIR	Name of directory containing the pdb++ library/archive

After fixing Makefile, you should be able to type "make" and create the
executable file "ksdssp".  Documentation for using the program may be
found in "ksdssp.1" in Unix manual page format, or "ksdssp.html" in
HyperText Mark-up Language.
